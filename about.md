All of Me

## About me
I am a cognitive science graduate and an engineer interested in spatial encoding. I did my Master of Science degree in Cognitive Science from Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar.

I did my master’s thesis at BRaIN lab, IIT Gandhinagar under the supervision of Dr. Krishna Prasad Miyapuram, on spatial encoding of auditory cues which looks at the neural signatures in the brain (using EEG) to understand auditory perception and location association of auditory cues. I looked at how a particular stimulus when localized to various locations gets represented at the neural level. We measured ERPs and ERSPs and showed their gradation with respect to location across different brain regions. I used psychophysical experiments in addition to EEG measurements and collected my own data for my thesis.

I have also worked as a *Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter* at Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin in the lab of Dr. Livia de Hoz setting up Neuropixels recording for auditory neuroscience experiments. I also analyzed neural spiking data for statistical learning in the brain.


The About page is a common convention found on websites.
It is your opportunity to let us know all the details "about" your project:

- focus and topic area
- people involved
- code and projects used
